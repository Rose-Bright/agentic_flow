## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Phone Disconnect Request

**Email Input:**
```
From: john.doe@email.com
Subject: Disconnect Phone Line

Hello,

I need to disconnect my phone number 555-123-4568 from my account.
This line is no longer needed.

Please process this request and confirm.

Thanks,

```

**Agent Processing:**
1. ✅ Email validated and customer found
2. 📱 Phone number extracted: `555-123-4568`
3. ✅ Number verified on customer account
4. ✅ Disconnect eligibility confirmed
5. 🎫 SmartPath ticket created: `SP20240101ABCD1234`
6. 📧 Confirmation email sent
7. 👥 Queued for human service center

### Example 2: Add Phone Line Request

**Email Input:**
```
From: jane.smith@email.com
Subject: Add New Phone Line

Dear Customer Service,

I would like to add a new phone line to my account for my business.
Please set up an additional number.

Best regards,

```

**Agent Processing:**
1. ✅ Email validated and customer found (Premium tier)
2. 📋 Add line request identified
3. ✅ Customer capacity check passed
4. 🎫 High-priority ticket created
5. 📧 Confirmation sent with timeline
6. 👥 Escalated to service center

## Configuration

### Agent Permissions
The TelecomServiceAgent requires the following permissions:
- `read_customer_data`
- `read_phone_services`
- `create_tickets`
- `update_tickets`
- `send_notifications`
- `write_analytics`
- `validate_service_requests`

### Business Rules

**Disconnect Eligibility:**
- Number must exist on customer account
- Cannot disconnect last active line
- No outstanding billing issues
- Service must be in active status

**Add Line Capacity:**
- Customer tier limits (Bronze: 3, Silver: 5, Gold: 8, Platinum: 10)
- Account must be in good standing
- No payment issues

**Priority Assignment:**
- **Critical**: N/A (automated processing)
- **High**: Platinum customers, or disconnect requests
- **Medium**: Gold customers, general requests
- **Low**: Standard add requests

## Testing

### Run Integration Test
```bash
python telecom_agent_integration.py
```

### Run Complete Demo
```bash
python telecom_demo.py
```

### Test Scenarios Covered
1. ✅ Valid disconnect request with existing phone number
2. ✅ Valid add line request with capacity available
3. ✅ Invalid email address (not in customer database)
4. ✅ Invalid phone number (not on customer account)
5. ✅ Business rule violations (capacity limits, eligibility)
6. ✅ Error handling and escalation

## Integration with LangGraph

The TelecomServiceAgent integrates seamlessly with the existing LangGraph orchestration:

1. **Agent Registration**: Added to `_initialize_agents()` in LangGraphOrchestrator
2. **Routing Logic**: Enhanced `_calculate_routing_scores()` to detect telecom requests
3. **Node Addition**: New `telecom_service` node in conversation graph
4. **Intent Mapping**: Added telecom-specific intent categories

### Routing Conditions
The agent is selected when:
- Email channel is detected
- Phone numbers are found in message
- Service request keywords are present (`disconnect`, `add`, `cancel`, etc.)
- Intent confidence is above threshold
